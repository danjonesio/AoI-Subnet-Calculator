- [x] **Width Constraints**: 80% width constraint works correctly across all breakpoints
- [x] **Content Readability**: Text remains readable at all screen sizes

## Implementation Details

### Theme-Consistent Styling System

The implementation uses a systematic approach to ensure theme compatibility:

```css
/* Spacing remains identical across themes */
.card-content { @apply p-6; }
.card-header { @apply p-6 pb-4; }
.section-spacing { @apply space-y-8; }
.form-spacing { @apply space-y-4; }

/* Typography hierarchy preserved */
.page-title { @apply text-2xl font-bold; }
.section-header { @apply text-xl font-semibold; }
.card-title { @apply text-lg font-medium; }
.body-text { @apply text-base; }
.label-text { @apply text-sm font-medium; }
.description-text { @apply text-sm text-muted-foreground; }

/* Interactive elements maintain consistent sizing */
.button-sm { @apply h-8 px-3; }
.button-default { @apply h-10 px-4; }
.button-lg { @apply h-12 px-6; }
.input-standard { @apply h-10; }
```

### Accessibility Features

1. **Focus Management**
   - All interactive elements use `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary`
   - Focus indicators visible in both themes
   - Logical tab order maintained

2. **Touch Accessibility**
   - Minimum 44px touch targets for all interactive elements
   - Adequate spacing between interactive elements
   - Responsive touch targets on mobile devices

3. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Proper form labeling with `htmlFor` attributes
   - Semantic HTML structure maintained
   - ARIA labels where appropriate

4. **Color and Contrast**
   - CSS variables ensure theme compatibility
   - Text colors automatically adjust with theme
   - Adequate contrast maintained in both themes

### Width Constraint Implementation

The 80% width constraint is implemented using:

```css
.main-container {
  max-width: min(80vw, 72rem); /* 80% viewport width, max 1152px */
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 1rem;
}

/* Responsive padding */
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .main-container { padding: 0 1.5rem; }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .main-container { padding: 0 2rem; }
}
```

## Performance Impact

### CSS Bundle Analysis

- **Utility Classes**: Consistent use of Tailwind utilities reduces CSS bundle size
- **Theme Variables**: CSS custom properties enable efficient theme switching
- **No Custom CSS**: Minimal custom styles reduce maintenance overhead
- **Purging**: Unused styles automatically removed in production

### Runtime Performance

- **Theme Switching**: Smooth transitions with no layout shifts
- **Rendering**: No performance degradation with new styling system
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient CSS variable system minimizes memory impact
