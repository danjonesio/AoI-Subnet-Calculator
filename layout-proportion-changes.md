# Layout Proportion Changes - Network Configuration & Calculated Network Details

## Changes Made

### Grid Layout Modification
Changed the main grid layout from equal 50/50 split to 1/3 and 2/3 proportions:

**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-4 sm:gap-6">
  <Card className="rounded-lg shadow-md">Network Configuration</Card>
  <Card className="rounded-lg shadow-md">Calculated Network Details</Card>
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4 sm:gap-6">
  <Card className="rounded-lg shadow-md lg:col-span-1">Network Configuration</Card>
  <Card className="rounded-lg shadow-md lg:col-span-2">Calculated Network Details</Card>
</div>
```

### Specific Changes

1. **Grid Container**: Changed from `lg:grid-cols-2` to `lg:grid-cols-3`
2. **Network Configuration Card**: Added `lg:col-span-1` (takes 1/3 width)
3. **Calculated Network Details Card**: Added `lg:col-span-2` (takes 2/3 width)

### Responsive Behavior

- **Mobile/Tablet** (`grid-cols-1`): Both cards stack vertically (unchanged)
- **Desktop** (`lg:grid-cols-3`): Network Configuration takes 1/3, Calculated Network Details takes 2/3

## Expected Results

### ✅ Layout Proportions
- Network Configuration section: **33.33%** width (1/3)
- Calculated Network Details section: **66.67%** width (2/3)

### ✅ Responsive Design
- Mobile devices: Cards stack vertically (no change)
- Tablet devices: Cards stack vertically (no change)  
- Desktop devices: New 1/3 and 2/3 proportions applied

### ✅ Visual Balance
- Network Configuration (input form) gets appropriate space for form elements
- Calculated Network Details (data table) gets more space for displaying results
- Better utilization of screen real estate

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the Subnet Calculator application
2. Navigate to the main page
3. Enter network details (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) and calculate
4. Verify the layout proportions:
   - Network Configuration card should be narrower (1/3 width)
   - Calculated Network Details card should be wider (2/3 width)
5. Test responsive behavior by resizing the browser window
6. Confirm mobile/tablet view still stacks cards vertically

## Benefits

1. **Better Space Utilization**: The results table gets more space to display network information clearly
2. **Improved UX**: Input form is more compact while results are more readable
3. **Visual Balance**: Creates better visual hierarchy with more emphasis on the calculated results
4. **Responsive**: Maintains mobile-friendly stacked layout on smaller screens

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The layout proportions have been successfully changed from 50/50 to 1/3 and 2/3 for the Network Configuration and Calculated Network Details sections respectively.
